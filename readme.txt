# Game Notes
- In order to hit the ball, click and hold onto the edge of the cue ball where you'd like to hit. 
- Then, drag your cursor away (in the angle you'd like to hit), and then release.
- The power of your hit will be based on the length of your drag (although ball velocity is capped). 

# Config Notes
